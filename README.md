This is the source code for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/award-cost-bot">u/award-cost-bot</a>, a Reddit bot built to calculate the USD cost of Reddit awards.

# Award Leaderboards

The bot keeps track of leaderboards for the <a href="https://redd.it/euxitc/">highest priced submissions</a> and <a href="https://redd.it/euxinc/">highest priced comments</a> from around Reddit. These leaderboards are constantly updated as the bot continues to be mentioned on new submissions and comments.

# FAQ

## How do I use the bot?

Mention the bot with "u/award-cost-bot" on any submission or comment and it will quickly respond with the total coins spent, a USD cost estimate, and the amount of Reddit Premium the author received from the awards.

## Are you sure these calculations are correct?

I use data fetched directly from Reddit's API so it is as accurate as possible. I make the assumption that most coins are bought at the 1800 coins / $5.99 price to estimate the cash value of the awards.
